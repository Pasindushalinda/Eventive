Imagine you’re building a corporate intranet where employees have access to different resources based on their roles and permissions. Here’s a more detailed scenario:

User Login and Claims Transformation:

When an employee logs in, the CustomClaimsTransformation class is triggered. This class fetches the user’s permissions from the IPermissionService based on their role and dynamically adds these permissions as claims to their ClaimsPrincipal.

Accessing Resources:

Employees navigate through the intranet, accessing various sections like financial reports, team dashboards, and confidential documents. Each resource is protected by an authorization policy that requires specific permissions.

Authorization Check:

When an employee attempts to access a resource, the PermissionAuthorizationHandler comes into play. It checks whether the user's claims include the necessary permission to access that resource. For instance, to view a confidential report, a user might need the ViewConfidentialReports permission.

Policy Provider:

If the required policy isn’t predefined, the PermissionAuthorizationPolicyProvider dynamically creates it based on the requested permission. This provider checks if the policy already exists; if not, it generates a new policy with the required PermissionRequirement.

Decision Making:

The AuthorizationHandler processes the authorization logic. If the user’s claims meet the required permission, access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied, and the user is informed they lack the necessary permissions.

This approach ensures that access control is flexible and scalable, accommodating changes in user roles and permissions without needing to hard-code policies for each scenario. It streamlines the management of permissions and enhances the security of your application.
